                    Theorizing the Web is an inter- and non-disciplinary annual conference that brings together
                    scholars, journalists, artists, activists, and technology practitioners to think conceptually and
                    critically about the interrelationships between the Web and society. We deeply value public
                    engagement, and consider insights from academics, non-academics, and non-“tech theorists” alike to
                    be equally valuable.

                    This is a paragraph section where you can place your writing such as how you framed the project,
                    what inspired you, what kind of research did you do, how did your idea evolve, what were key points
                    of your refinement process, etc. Each paragraph will need to go into a separate paragraph tag.
