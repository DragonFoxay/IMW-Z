                <h2>My Plan and Outcome</h2>
                <p>
                    My plan right from the start was to add animation effects and use flexbox. Using tons of @media,
                    ::after, and more classroom content. I took a while to come up with a decent color scheme for my
                    website so it would compliment the info I chose.
                </p>

                <h2>My Struggles</h2>
                <p>
                    I had css issues, html issues, got mixed up with class names and labeling. I got lost in my
                    own code. In the beginning I was tring to use the Holy grail layout but failed to do so with
                    the number of content I had, I had to switch to grid. Then I had issues making it responsive.
                    Many child items were overlapping, not adjusting, not shrinking. The background was not covering
                    the whole website. The margins kept getting overridding and messing up with the padding.

                    <figcaption>This is how it started and the stages it went through to get to where it is...
                        I used colors to section off the items so I can see what I was doing and that helped.
