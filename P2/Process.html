                    My plan right from the start was to add animation effects and use flexbox. Using tons of @media,
                    ::after, and more classroom content.

                    I had css issues, html issues, got mixed up with class names and labeling. I got lost in my
                    own code. In the beginning I was tring to use the Holy grail layout but failed to do so with
                    the number of content I had, I had to switch to grid. Then I had issues making it responsive.
