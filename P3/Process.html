                <p>
                    I loved the one example provided with the windows and thats some what how mind ended up i tried
                    to add as much draggable things to the best of my ability while still making it look pretty and 3d
                    :).

                <h2>My Struggles</h2>
                <p>
                    So my stuggles would have to be being able to do my first idea which was trying to make a draggable
                    slider which
                    I did end up being able to make but the slider was not able to do what I wanted it to do which was
                    flip between two codes.
